# Learning from Images: A Distillation Learning Framework for Event Cameras

## Summary
This repository aims to provide a dowloading link of the multi-modal dataset proposed by the following paper. Please cite following paper if you use this dataset in your own work. The paper is avalable via: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9426390.

## Dataset: CEP-DVS
We present a RGB-event paired dataset, namely Cifar-Event paired dataset (CEP-DVS). This dataset is recorded with random motion conditions and is compatible with mutli-modality visual tasks. The dowloading link of this dataset is: (will be available soon).
